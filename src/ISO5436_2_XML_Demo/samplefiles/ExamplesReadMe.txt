This directory contains some simple examples for the ISO5436-2
xml-file format. The data files have the ending ".XSP" and are
zip-containers. You can rename them to ".zip" and then easyly unpack 
and inspect their contents.

For each example the is the central xml-document. Documents ending
in "_bin.*" belong to binary encoded profile data files. The other
contain xml-encoded profile data.
