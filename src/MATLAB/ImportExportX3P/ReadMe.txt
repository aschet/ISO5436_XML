This directory contains MATLAB interface files ("mex" files) that
provide an import and export in x3p dataformat in matlab.

Preconditions for compiling mex files: CodeSynthesis XSD-tool 3.0 has
to be installed.

To build the mex files start matlab, configure your c-compiler by typing

  mex -setup

at the command prompt.

Then start compilation by executing the m-file

  MakeX3PMex

This will copy all libraries and the resulting mex files to the
current directory.

MakeX3PMex is preconfigured for windows systems. You will get a
warning or error message if you have to change the configuration for
your system.
